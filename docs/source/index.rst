CreateVTLCorpus
===============
``create_vtl_corpus`` allows to automatically create control parameter
trajectories for the VocalTractLab (VTL) artculatory synthesizer for a large
corpus of speech audio files and transcriptions of these files. It includes the
code to align the transcriptions to the audio with the Monreal Forced Aligner
(MFA). ``create_vtl_corpus`` is mainly used and tested with data from the
Mozilla Common Voice project.
