Troubleshooting and known issues

Problems with the aligner
==========================
Sometimes the aligner will not generate phonemes for the whole sentence in our setup.
Since we rely on these phonemes to synthesise the audio, we have to return a empty dataframe for the sentence this occurs in with a warning.
On other occasions the aligner will not generate a textgrid file for the sentence. In this case an empty dataframe is also returned with a warning.
Those occasions are not common however.


Seperating words 
================
Sometimes word seperating is not uniform, since the transcript also seperates words differently, also if we encounter a fringe case where words are not 
able to be seperates so that the transcript generated by the aligner and the transcript given in the dataset do not match, we have to return a empty dataframe for the 
sentence this occurs in.
currently, at least for multiprocessing we also do not check if the words in the transcript are the same as the words in the transcript given by aligner, this is a possible future improvement.
While they align in the majority of cases expect some fringe cases where they do not align.
Furthermore,when words in the whole corpus are counted for words and then put in a frozen set
