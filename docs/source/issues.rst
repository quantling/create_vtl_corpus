Troubleshooting and known issues
=====================================



Problems with the aligner
==========================
Sometimes the aligner will not generate phonemes for the whole sentence in our setup.
Since we rely on these phonemes to synthesise the audio, we have to return a empty dataframe for the sentence this occurs in with a warning.
On other occasions the aligner will not generate a textgrid file for the sentence. In this case an empty dataframe is also returned with a warning.
Those occasions are not common however.


Seperating words 
================
Sometimes word seperating is not uniform, since the transcript also seperates words differentl, also if we encounter a fringe case where words are not 
able to be seperates so that the transcript generated by the aligner and the transcript given in the dataset do not match, we have to return a empty dataframe for the 
sentence this occurs in.
currently, at least for multiprocessing we also do not check if the words in the transcript are the same as the words in the transcript given by aligner, this is a possible future improvement.
While they align in the majority of cases expect some fringe cases where they do not align.
Furthermore,when words in the whole corpus are counted for words and then put in a frozen set. 

Estimations of lost words and amount of total words in the corpus
=================================================================
Words that would be skipped because they occur less than 4 times in the corpus are not counted in the total amount of words in the corpus or in the amount lost words.
The amount of words in the corpus and the amount of lost words are only estimated if a word seperation error occurs. We then simply split the transcript by spaces and count the words and divide them by a factor of 1.001 since
some of the words in a sentence might not occur 4 times or more, so we would have skipped them anyways. Please adjust the factor for your own corpus if you have a different word distribution and/or a 
minimum word count that is different from our standard 4 times or more.
For other secenarios the words are counted and  we follow the word seperation done by the aligner. 


Further issues
