How to use?
===========

Many commands can be used to create a corpus with the library.
Use the --help function of -h to get more information about the commands.

This is a collection of possible use cases, which we target the library for.

1. Create the vtl corpus with no pre-existing data but not all of the files, i.
   e. only 10_000 samples.

2. Add new data to an already existing corpus, add 10_000 new samples.

3. Filter after words? Create 1000 more "post" word types.
